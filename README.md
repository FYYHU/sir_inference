# SIR Inference

See
- [Testing_strategy](Testing_strategy.ipynb)
notebook for a demo
- [Scatterplot_mean_field_dmp](Scatterplot_mean_field_dmp.ipynb) for
a sanity check comparing the probabilities estimated by mean field / DMP to
the frequencies obtained by Monte Carlo runs.

Demonstratation of the package can be found on these google colab notebooks:
