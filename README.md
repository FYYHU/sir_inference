# Probabilistic inference framework for estimatingrisk of infection from proximity tracking data

The method is based on the SIR inference model we describe in [these notes](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tfhcpbvhmcwq
), where you cna find more information about our approach.

Simple demonstration of the package and of the inference procedure can be found on these google colab notebooks:

- [Demo 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15qClUFJl_mWTVL6e2VG9mgsAgRQ9Armb)

- [Demo 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DJP-8rYwjJU9p63HUYpiDYlod3riJvJs)

- See [Scatterplot](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QcK2ilzqRiE7bnHqrfxjHhXbwEs_12WU) for a sanity check comparing the probabilities estimated by mean field / DMP to the frequencies obtained by Monte Carlo runs.
